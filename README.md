CSPB 3112 - Spring 2024 - Knox - Professional Development in Computer Science

My project proposal for CSPB 3112 Spring 2024 with Professor Knox is to turn my final project from the SQL Database class I took last semester (CSPB 3287) into an actual working website using Django. By the end of this semester, my goal is to have the website usable and publicly facing. I will use Heroku for hosting. 

For reference, this is my SQL project from last semester: https://github.com/RyanColorado04/CSPB-3287-Project.

My public web site where my current project is to be documented will be here: https://github.com/RyanColorado04/CSPB-3112_Spring_2024. 

My vision for this project is to create a nonprofit online store that donates all profits to charity using Django. Django is a popular full-stack web framework for building web applications. A full-stack framework means that it provides tools and components for both the front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) development of web applications. Django includes many built-in features such as handling database operations, user authentication, URL routing, and form handling, while also providing a template system for generating HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for front-end development.

If I successfully create this project, I will be using and learning many technologies including Python, database operations with SQL, web design (CSS, HTML, JavaScript), API calls, and web hosting (with Heroku). This will allow me to bring together everything I have learned so far in this program into one final project that showcases my knowledge. Also, full-stack web development is a very lucrative and marketable skill in the industry today.

For a simple background on my motivation for this project, my sister is an adult with disabilities, and I’ve always wanted to create a nonprofit store that sells merchandise and then donates all the proceeds to organizations that provide long time care to these adults, allowing them to work and live better lives. This is extremely expensive and there just isn’t enough resources to go around, so this is my hypothetical online nonprofit to help fix this problem. 

This project will be theoretical, and I won't implement a payment processor or sell merchandise, but everything else should be in place by the end of this semester. Other than those two functions, the website should have all the functionality of an online store. This includes creating an account, making purchases, generating receipts, and uploading items. 

The biggest risk for this project is that there is a lot to learn and then program since it incorporates so many tools and technologies. However, I started learning Django over the winter break, so I am already way ahead of where I need to be. Plus, Django does a lot of the work for you, so unlike a tool like Flask, a lot of functionality is already built in, such as the user account creation. For example, the user account creation already has a default package, and even if you want to add additional functionality, you can just add onto an already created class. Because of how Django is designed to be so user friendly, I believe I should be able to add one piece of functionality every week, and by the end of the semester, most of it will be completed.

To mitigate this issue, I will take basic steps every week. For example, the first week I will just get the website working with basic routing. Then I will upgrade the user interface. Once the interface is upgraded to look more professional, I will create user accounts. Then, the database will be created. And I will then build on the website continually like this throughout the semester, documenting my accomplishments every week on Piazza, GitHub, and my blog. This slow building over the course of the semester should make it possible for me to finish most of, if not all, of what I am planning. Also, through this design method, even if I do not finish everything I planned, the website will still be highly functional by the time the semester is over. Another important mitigation is that the design was already completed last semester (and linked above) in my SQL class here at the University of Colorado. I am just implementing what already works in Django.

For learning, I am using two sources. The first is Corey Schafer's YouTube videos on Django: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p. 

The second is the book Django for Beginners: Build Websites with Python and Django by William S. Vincent, which can be found here: https://www.amazon.com/Django-Beginners-Build-Websites-Python/dp/1735467200. 

I have also started looking over how to do SQL queries in Django. The documentation for that can be found here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/db/queries/. I will convert my SQL code from my project to use the API that converts database-table data into Python objects.

Finally, I have mapped out the first 6 weeks of my project. I have not gone further than this because I want to be able to adjust halfway through the semester to increase the goals or pull back if they are too ambitious. These are my plans for the first 6 weeks and the bare minimum of what I hope to accomplish. Please note, that Week 1 below is technically Week 3 of the semester because we have spent the first two weeks researching what we want our project to be. I plan on having the Week 1 below completed by the time the next update is due, and these plans will take me about 9 weeks into the semester. If all these goals are met, I will consider it successful, but I am hoping to accomplish much more.

Weekly plan for CSPB 3112 - Spring 2024

Week 1: 
Setup my Django project environment, including initial configurations and a Git repository for version control.

Week 2: 
Design and implement my database schema using Django models and perform the initial migrations.

Week 3: 
Set up the Django admin interface for content management and create basic views and URL mappings for site navigation.

Week 4: 
Implement user authentication and develop advanced views to enhance site functionality and user interaction.

Week 5: 
Improve the site's front-end with CSS frameworks for styling and JavaScript for dynamic content.

Week 6:
Conduct testing and debugging, then deploy the application to Heroku, ensuring it works as expected in a production environment.
